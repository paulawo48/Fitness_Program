# Fitness_Program
This fitness program project is made 3 parts focusing on initally analysing the user's pyhysical parameters to determine their fitness level and recommended calorie intake. It then creates a individualised workout routine, based on a hypertrophy or strength goal, before allowing the user to log their total reps on a daily basis.
